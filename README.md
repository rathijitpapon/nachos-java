# nachos-java

This is a **operating system** project where we are building a simulating operating system called **Nachos**


## Nachos Introduction

NACHOS stands for *Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System*. 

This was developed in 1992 originally in C++. Later, a Java version was written. Basic Nachos has an incomplete threading system. It
also does not support multiple programming (multiple user processes in the same physical memory
space).


## Assignment Instructions

This assignment is organized in two parts.

    Part 1: Threading
    Part 2: Multiprogramming
    
### Part 1: Threading Tasks

Your working directory for this part will be the proj1 directory. The files where you will code are in the
package nachos.threads. Nachos does not fully support multiple kernel threads. In this part of the
assignment, you will enable Nachos to support multiple kernel threads.

    Task 1: Implement KThread.join(). Note that another thread does not have to call join(),
    but if it is called, it must be called only once. The result of calling join() a second time on the
    same thread is undefined, even if the second caller is a different thread than the first caller. A
    thread must finish executing normally whether it is joined.
    
    
    Task 2: Implement condition variables directly, by using interrupt enable and disable to provide
    atomicity. We have provided a sample implementation that uses semaphores; your job is to
    provide an equivalent implementation without directly using semaphores (you may of course still
    use locks, even though they indirectly use semaphores). Once you are done, you will have two
    alternative implementations that provide the exact same functionality. Your second
    implementation of condition variables must reside in class nachos.threads.Condition2.
    
    
    Task 3: Complete the implementation of the Alarm class, by implementing the
    waitUntil(long x) method. A thread calls waitUntil to suspend its own execution until
    time has advanced to at least now + x. This is useful for threads that operate in real-time, for
    example, for blinking the cursor once per second. There is no requirement that threads start
    running immediately after waking up; just put them on the ready queue in the timer interrupt
    handler after they have waited for at least the right amount of time. Do not fork any additional
    threads to implement waitUntil(); you need only modify waitUntil() and the timer
    interrupt handler. waitUntil is not limited to one thread; any number of threads may call it
    and be suspended at any one time.
    
    
    Task 4: Implement synchronous send and receive of one-word messages using condition
    variables (don't use semaphores!). Implement the Communicator class with operations, void
    speak (int word) and int listen().
    
    speak() atomically waits until listen() is called on the same Communicator object, and
    then transfers the word over to listen(). Once the transfer is made, both can return. Similarly,
    listen() waits until speak() is called, at which point the transfer is made, and both can
    return (listen() returns the word). Your solution should work even if there are multiple
    speakers and listeners for the same Communicator (note: this is equivalent to a zero-length
    bounded buffer; since the buffer has no room, the producer and consumer must interact directly,
    requiring that they wait for one another). Each communicator should only use exactly one lock. If
    you're using more than one lock, you're making things too complicated.
    
    
    Task 5: Write test code for all the previous four tasks. Without the test code, you will not get any
    marks for that task. The purpose of the test code is to use the methods that you have implemented
    and demonstrate that they work.



### Part 2: Multiprogramming user processes

Your working directory for this part will be the proj2 directory. That is, you will go to this directory and
type gmake clean, gmake and nachos here. The files where you add your code for this part will be
in nachos.userprog package.

Up to now, all the code you have written for Nachos has been part of the operating system kernel. In a
real operating system, the kernel not only uses its procedures internally, but allows user-level programs
to access some of its routines them via system calls.

The first step is to read and understand the part of the system we have written for you. The kernel files
are in the nachos.userprog package, and there are a few additional machine simulation classes that
get used:

    Processor simulates a MIPS processor.
    
    SerialConsole simulates a serial console (for keyboard input and text output).
    
    FileSystem is a file system interface. To access files, use the FileSystem returned by
    Machine.stubFileSystem(). This file system accesses files in the test directory.
    

The new kernel files for Part 2 include:

    UserKernel.java - a multiprogramming kernel.
    
    UserProcess.java - a user process; manages the address space, and loads a program into
    virtual memory.
    
    UThread.java - a thread capable of executing user MIPS code.
    
    SynchConsole.java - a synchronized console; makes it possible to share the machine's serial
    console among multiple threads
    
    
The provided code can run a single user-level MIPS program at a time, and supports just one system call:
halt. All halt does is ask the operating system to shut the machine down. This test program is found
in test/halt.c and represents the simplest supported MIPS program.

We have provided several other example MIPS programs in the test directory of the Nachos distribution.
You can use these programs to test your implementation, or you can write new programs. Of course, you
won't be able to run the programs which make use of features such as I/O until you implement the
appropriate kernel support! That will be your task in this project.

To run user .c programs on nachos, please see the other instruction file on Moodle.


#### Part 2 Tasks

Nachos can run only one user program as a Nachos process. It can not run more than one user program.
The goal of Part 2 is to enhance Nachos so that it can support multiple user processes.

    Task 1: Implement the system calls read and write documented in syscall.h. You will see
    the code for halt in UserProcess.java; it is best for you to place your new system calls here
    too.
    
    We have provided you the assembly code necessary to invoke system calls from user
    programs (see start.s; the SYSCALLSTUB macro generates assembly code for each
    syscall).

    You will need to bullet-proof the Nachos kernel from user program errors; there should be
    nothing a user program can do to crash the operating system (with the exception of explicitly
    invoking the halt() syscall). In other words, you must be sure that user programs do not
    pass bogus arguments to the kernel which causes the kernel to corrupt its internal state or
    that of other processes.

    You should make it so that the halt() system call can only be invoked by the "root" process
    â€“ that is, the first process in the system. If another process attempts to invoke halt(), the
    system call should be ignored and return immediately.

    When a system call wishes to indicate an error condition to the user, it should return -1 (not
    throw an exception within the kernel!). Otherwise, the system call should return the
    appropriate value as documented in test/syscall.h.

    When any process is started, its file descriptors 0 and 1 must refer to standard input and standard output.
    Use UserKernel.console.openForReading() and UserKernel.console.openForWriting() to make this easier. 
    A user process is allowed to close these descriptors, just like descriptors returned by open().
    
    
    
    Task 2: Implement support for multiprogramming. The code we have given you is restricted to
    running one user process at a time; your job is to make it work for multiple user processes.
    
    
    Come up with a way of allocating the machine's physical memory so that different processes
    do not overlap in their memory usage. Note that the user programs do not make use of
    malloc() or free(), meaning that user programs effectively have no dynamic memory
    allocation needs (and therefore, no heap). What this means is that you know the complete
    memory needs of a process when it is created. You can allocate a fixed number of pages for
    the processe's stack; 8 pages should be sufficient.
    

    We suggest maintaining a global linked list of free physical pages (perhaps as part of the
    UserKernel class). Be sure to use synchronization where necessary when accessing this
    list. Your solution must make efficient use of memory by allocating pages for the new process
    wherever possible. This means that it is not acceptable to only allocate pages in a contiguous
    block; your solution must be able to make use of "gaps" in the free memory pool.
    
    Also be sure that all of a process's memory is freed on exit (whether it exits normally, via the
    syscall exit(), or abnormally, due to an illegal operation).
    
    
    Modify UserProcess.readVirtualMemory and UserProcess.writeVirtual
    Memory, which copy data between the kernel and the user's virtual address space, so that
    they work with multiple user processes. The physical memory of the MIPS machine is accessed
    through the method Machine.processor().getMemory(); the total number of
    physical pages is Machine.processor().getNumPhysPages(). You should maintain
    the pageTable for each user process, which maps the user's virtual addresses to physical
    addresses. The TranslationEntry class represents a single virtual-to-physical page
    translation. The field TranslationEntry.readOnly should be set to true if the page is
    coming from a COFF section which is marked as read-only. You can determine this using the
    method CoffSection.isReadOnly(). Note that these methods should not throw
    exceptions when they fail; instead, they must always return the number of bytes transferred
    (even if that number is zero).


    Modify UserProcess.loadSections() so that it allocates the number of pages that it
    needs (that is, based on the size of the user program), using the allocation policy that you
    decided upon above. This method should also set up the pageTable structure for the process
    so that the process is loaded into the correct physical memory pages. If the new user process
    cannot fit into physical memory, exec() should return an error.

    Note that the user threads (see the UThread class) already save and restore user machine
    state, as well as process state, on context switches. So, you are not responsible for these
    details.




    Task 3: Implement the system calls (exec, join, and exit, also documented in syscall.h).
    
    Again, all the addresses passed in registers to exec and join are virtual addresses. You should
    use readVirtualMemory and readVirtualMemoryString to transfer memory
    between the kernel and the user process.

    Again, you must bullet-proof these syscalls.

    Unlike KThread.join(), only a process's parent can join to it. For instance, if A executes
    B and B executes C, A is not allowed to join to C, but B is allowed to join to C.

    join takes a process ID as an argument, used to uniquely identify the child process which
    the parent wishes to join with. The process ID should be a globally unique positive integer,
    assigned to each process when it is created. The easiest way of accomplishing this is to
    maintain a static counter which indicates the next process ID to assign. Since the process ID
    is an int, then it may be possible for this value to overflow if there are many processes in the
    system. For this project you are not expected to deal with this case; that is, assume that the
    process ID counter will not overflow.

    When a process calls exit(), its thread should be terminated immediately, and the process
    should clean up any state associated with it (i.e. free up memory, close open files, etc).
    Perform the same cleanup if a process exits abnormally.

    The exit status of the exiting process should be transferred to the parent, in case the parent
    calls the join system call. The exit status of a process that exits abnormally is up to you.
    For the purposes of join, a child process exits normally if it calls the exit syscall with any status,
    and abnormally if the kernel kills it (e.g. due to an unhandled exception).

    The last process to call exit() should cause the machine to halt by calling
    Kernel.kernel.terminate(). (Note that only the root process should be allowed to
    invoke the halt() system call, but the last exiting process should call
    Kernel.kernel.terminate() directly.)
    
    
    
    Task 4: Write a test c program which makes use of all the three features that you have implemented,
    i.e. reading from console, writing to console, making valid and invalid system calls, forking other
    processes using the syscall exec, waiting for them using join, letting multiple processes work
    in parallel by forking multiple processes, trying to halt as non-root process, trying to halt as root
    process etc. Be innovative. Compile a coff file using a cross-compiler, then start nachos using
    this coff executable as the default shell program (see nachos.conf file).
