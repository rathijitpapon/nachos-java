# nachos-java

This is a **operating system** project where we are building a simulating operating system called **Nachos**


## Nachos Introduction

NACHOS stands for *Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System*. 

This was developed in 1992 originally in C++. Later, a Java version was written. Basic Nachos has an incomplete threading system. It
also does not support multiple programming (multiple user processes in the same physical memory
space).
